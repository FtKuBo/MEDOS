# MEDOS: Minimalistic x86 Operating System

#### State : not finished
##### Project Status: Functional; serves as a learning project and a foundation for further development. The project is on pause but will be resumed in the future.

MEDOS is an experimental operating system written in C and NASM (x86 assembly) for 32-bit systems. It boots using GRUB and includes basic components such as the kernel, VGA support, GDT (Global Descriptor Table), IDT (Interrupt Descriptor Table), keyboard input, PIT (Programmable Interval Timer), and MMU (Memory Management Unit) with paging.


Dependencies:

Linux Environment is prefered - Cross-compiler (adjust Makefile) - NASM - GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) - LD (GNU Linker) - GRUB

Run project:
```shell

```
